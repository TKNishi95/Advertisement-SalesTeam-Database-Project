The project aimed to create a database for advertising companies to track and manage the performance of their sales teams effectively. The premise of this project was inspired by a real-world consulting case experienced by one of the collaborators, in which a large advertising firm faced severe financial challenges and a loss of market share to its competitors. The main source of the issue was attributed to the firm's lack of a centralized monitoring system that could closely track the progress of their sales group's performance, hindering decision-makers from making effective strategic decisions.


As a potential solution, we propose a sales team performance database management system (using SQL) with the following characteristics: 
- Comprehensive Data Management: Tracking detailed sales activity (i.e. Client Meeting, Contract, Payment, etc)
- Real-Time Performance Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPI), highlighting each sales team's efficacy
- Data-Driven Decision Support: Enable sales managers and higher decision makers to make strategic decisions on sales
- Strategic Investment Reallocation: Allow to identify high-performing and underperforming teams, thereby facilitating the decision to make any corrective measures


Our database allows the query of the following KPIs that are considered essential for Sales Teams of the advertising industry:
- Customer Development: Number of new clients
- Decision Chain Mastery: Decision maker contacted
- Client Engagement: Number of meetings with clients conducted
- Deal Closing: Number of contracts as well as their signed value
- Payment Collection: Payment status by client on existing contracts
- Client Satisfaction: Client satisfaction with contracts
